### Tasks
to refute or confirm the hypotheses put forward in order to find a connection between subscription payments and one-time donations
Hypotheses:

- Hypothesis 1 - among donors, the vast majority make payments either only by subscription, or only one-time. Philanthropists making payments both by subscription and one-time - a rarity
- Hypothesis 2 - anomalously high values of payments (both by subscription and one-time) for the donors make it possible to find promising and more involved philanthropists in the product
- Hypothesis 3 - among donors making payments both by subscription and one-time, the amounts of recurrent and non-current payments are interconnected - the larger the recurring payment, the smaller the one-time
- Hypothesis 4 - the frequency of one-time payments from donors making payments both by subscription and one-time - is low
- Hypothesis 5 - donors first make one-time payments and then switch to a subscription
