### Tasks

We help the association to support families raising children with special needs in the Belgorod region for the Driver of Growth based on the data of family foster homes VORDI.
We have an already prepared dataset
The customer already uses dashboards but wants to improve them, so our task will be to prepare the data and present to the customer projects of how these dashboards might look.
The survey was developed by professional sociologists, so it contains as many as 400 questions and 2000 answers in 2 years. The questions are related both to the characteristics of the family of a disabled child and to the availability of various services.
